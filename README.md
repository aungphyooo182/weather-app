## Setup Document:

### 1. Introduction:

The Weather App is a web application built using the React framework and a combination of APIs, including UNSPLASH_API, openweathermap API, wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi API, to provide users with up-to-date weather information and a visually appealing experience. The primary purpose of the Weather App is to allow users to quickly access current weather conditions for their current location or any other city they wish to search for, along with a 7-day forecast and an accompanying background image that reflects the selected city's atmosphere.

Key Features:

1. **Current Weather**: Users can instantly view the current weather conditions of their current location upon opening the app. This includes details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

2. **City Search**: The app enables users to search for weather information in other cities by typing in the city name. The app utilizes the wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi API to provide autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

3. **7-Day Forecast**: Users can access a comprehensive 7-day weather forecast for any selected city. This forecast includes daily temperature highs and lows, as well as expected weather conditions.

4. **City Background Image**: To enhance the user experience, the app dynamically fetches background images from the UNSPLASH_API based on the selected city. This visually appealing feature adds context and atmosphere to the weather information.

5. **User Location Detection**: The app uses the react-geolocated package to detect the user's current location and display the weather information accordingly.

6. **Loading Indicator**: The react-loader-progressbar package is implemented to provide a loading indicator while fetching weather data from the APIs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

7. **Enhanced UI Components**: The app integrates react-select-async-paginate and react-accessible-accordion components to improve the user interface. The former helps manage asynchronous city search suggestions, while the latter enhances the collapsible sections for weather details.

Technologies Used:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- UNSPLASH_API: Used to retrieve background images based on city names.
- openweathermap API: Provides weather data for the specified cities.
- wft-geo-db.p.rapidapi API: Offers city search autocomplete suggestions and geographical data.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout of the app.
- react-select-async-paginate: Enhances city search functionality.
- react-accessible-accordion: Improves the accordion-style weather details section.
- react-geolocated: Facilitates user location detection.
- react-loader-progressbar: Displays loading indicators during API calls.

In summary, the Weather App is designed to deliver accurate and visually appealing weather information to users through a combination of React components and various APIs, creating an engaging and user-friendly experience for checking weather conditions and forecasts in different cities.

### 2. Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- Git installed
- API key from the weather API provider

### 3. Installation Steps:

The step-by-step process to install and set up the project locally. This may include:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd weather-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file and add your API key: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`
5. Start the development server: `npm start`

### 4. Configuration:

Explain any configuration files or settings that need to be modified, if applicable. For example, if the weather API has different endpoints for development and production environments.

### 5. Usage:

How to use the Weather App once it's set up:

- Open a web browser
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
